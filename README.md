# Violence_detection
* The above kernal deals with the creation of a Deep Learning based Classifier, which classfifies violent Weapons in the provided images.
* Images categories are like<br>
                    * Guns.<br>
                    * Knife<br>

                    * Tanks<br> etc.

* Following tools were used to buld the classfifier model :<br>
                                          * Keras,<br>
                                          * Python,<br>
